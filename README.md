**Scaffolding Factory** is a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to scaffold professional web projects in seconds. It bridges the gap between complex full-stack frameworks and lightweight custom setups by providing high-quality boilerplate for both **Laravel** and **Vanilla PHP**, fully containerized and ready for production-grade development.

## 🛠️ What it does

This tool automates the tedious setup process of modern web applications:
- **Dual Architecture Support**: Choose between the robust Laravel ecosystem or a clean, optimized Vanilla PHP structure.
- **Docker-First Workflow**: Automatically generates `docker-compose.yml` configurations (Laravel Sail or Custom Apache/PHP 8.3) so your environment is consistent everywhere.
- **Instant Authentication**:
    - **Laravel**: Integration with Breeze, Jetstream, or Official Starter Kits.
    - **Vanilla PHP**: Optional Session-based Login Kit with PDO, including registration and secure session management.
- **Modern Styling**: Out-of-the-box support for **Tailwind CSS v4** or **Bootstrap 5**.
- **Onboarding Automation**: Generates a `scripts/install.sh` script that handles environment setup for new collaborators (dependencies, environment variables, and containers).

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using Scaffolding Factory, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **PHP 8.3+**: Required to run the CLI tool and the generated projects.
- **Composer**: Required for installing PHP dependencies (used during project setup).
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Essential for the containerized development environment.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and version control management.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to create your first project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Since this tool is not available on Composer, you'll need to clone the repository directly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roldante05/scaffolding-factory.git
cd scaffolding-factory
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required PHP dependencies using Composer:
```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Make the CLI Accessible
The CLI tool is available at `bin/scaffold`. You can:
- Use it directly: `php bin/scaffold new my-web-project`
- Or add the `bin` directory to your PATH for easier access:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"
  # Add above line to your shell profile (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc) for permanent access
  ```

### 4. Create a New Project
Run the `new` command and provide a name for your project:
```bash
scaffold new my-web-project
```

### 5. Follow the Interactive Wizard
The CLI uses a premium TUI (Terminal User Interface) with **Laravel Prompts**. Use the arrow keys to select your preferences:
- **Project Type**: Laravel or PHP Vanilla.
- **Starter Kit**: Choose your authentication and stack preferences.
- **Database**: Select from SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.
- **Design**: Pick your favorite CSS framework.

### 6. Initialize and Run
Once the scaffolding is complete, navigate to your project folder and run the installation script.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `scripts/install.sh` script is designed to automate the setup for **anyone who clones the repository** (e.g., from GitHub). It installs Composer dependencies via Docker, creates the `.env` file, and starts the containers.

```bash
cd my-web-project
bash scripts/install.sh
```
This script will build your Docker environment, install dependencies, and provide you with a local URL (usually `http://localhost`) where your app is running.

## 📖 Available Flows

### Laravel Ecosystem
- **Official Kits**: Breeze (Blade, Livewire, Inertia), Jetstream (Livewire, Inertia).
- **Database**: Full support for standard SQL drivers.
- **Sail Integration**: Pre-configured for easy container management.

> [!NOTE]
> **SQL Server** is listed in the database options but has limitations with Sail. SQL Server requires the `pdo_sqlsrv` PHP extension, which is not included in the default Sail Docker containers. If you select SQL Server, Sail will not be installed and you will need to configure your own database connection. For local development with SQL Server, consider using [Laravel Herd Pro](https://herd.laravel.com) or a local SQL Server instance.

### Using a Database Server with Sail

When you select a Starter Kit, the installer defaults to SQLite. If you later want to switch to MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL, add the corresponding service to your `compose.yaml` and update the `.env`.

#### MySQL

Add this service under `services:` in `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
mysql:
    image: 'mysql/mysql-server:8.0'
    ports:
        - '${FORWARD_DB_PORT:-3306}:3306'
    environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: '${DB_PASSWORD}'
        MYSQL_ROOT_HOST: '%'
        MYSQL_DATABASE: '${DB_DATABASE}'
        MYSQL_USER: '${DB_USERNAME}'
        MYSQL_PASSWORD: '${DB_PASSWORD}'
        MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: 'yes'
    volumes:
        - 'sail-mysql:/var/lib/mysql'
    networks:
        - sail
```

Add the volume under `volumes:`:

```yaml
volumes:
    sail-mysql:
        driver: local
```

Update your `.env`:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

#### MariaDB

```yaml
mariadb:
    image: 'mariadb:10'
    ports:
        - '${FORWARD_DB_PORT:-3306}:3306'
    environment:
        MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD: '${DB_PASSWORD}'
        MARIADB_DATABASE: '${DB_DATABASE}'
        MARIADB_USER: '${DB_USERNAME}'
        MARIADB_PASSWORD: '${DB_PASSWORD}'
    volumes:
        - 'sail-mariadb:/var/lib/mysql'
    networks:
        - sail
```

```yaml
volumes:
    sail-mariadb:
        driver: local
```

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mariadb
DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

#### PostgreSQL

```yaml
pgsql:
    image: 'postgres:16'
    ports:
        - '${FORWARD_DB_PORT:-5432}:5432'
    environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: '${DB_USERNAME}'
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: '${DB_PASSWORD}'
        POSTGRES_DB: '${DB_DATABASE}'
    volumes:
        - 'sail-pgsql:/var/lib/postgresql/data'
    networks:
        - sail
```

```yaml
volumes:
    sail-pgsql:
        driver: local
```

```env
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=pgsql
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

> [!NOTE]
> After adding the service, run `docker compose up -d` to start it, then `sail artisan migrate` to create the tables.

### Vanilla PHP
- **MVC Ready**: Structured directories for a clean separation of concerns.
### Vanilla PHP (Powered by ChePHP)
- **ActiveRecord ORM**: Fluent query builder with `find()`, `where()`, `save()`, `delete()`, and `paginate()`. Automatic table name inference from class names. Supports MySQL and SQLite.
- **Migration System**: File-based migrations with batch tracking and rollback. Write simple PHP files with `up`/`down` SQL, then run `php che migrate` to apply changes.
- **CLI Tool (`che`)**: Built-in artisan-like commands — `php che migrate`, `php che rollback`, `php che serve`, `php che route:list`.
- **Clean Routes**: Routes live in `app/routes.php` with zero inline HTML. Every route points to a Controller method. No more mixing HTML with routing logic.
- **Centralized Config**: Database, app, and auth settings in a single `config/config.php` file with environment variable overrides.
- **Auth System**: Session-based authentication with CSRF protection, Argon2id hashing, and secure cookie configuration.
- **Clean URLs**: Automated `.htaccess` configuration for extension-less routing (e.g., `/dashboard` instead of `dashboard.php`).
- **Dockerized**: Apache/PHP 8.3 with MySQL or SQLite, ready in seconds.
